#Heroes of PyMoli
As a "Lead Analyst" for an independent gaming company, I am tasked with analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. Working mostly with data digestion, I am looking to derive the following: 
  Player Count
  Purchasing analysis of all data points
  Gender demographics: analysis
  Age Demographics
  Top Spenders
  Most Popular Items
  Most Profitable Items

Brainstorming
Player Count

  Purchasing Analysis (Total)

    Number of Unique Items
    Average Purchase Price
    Total Number of Purchases
    Total Revenue


Gender Demographics

    Percentage and Count of Male Players
    Percentage and Count of Female Players
    Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed


Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

  The below each broken by gender

    Purchase Count
    Average Purchase Price
    Total Purchase Value
    Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender




Age Demographics

  The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)

    Purchase Count
    Average Purchase Price
    Total Purchase Value
    Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group




Top Spenders

  Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

    SN
    Purchase Count
    Average Purchase Price
    Total Purchase Value




Most Popular Items

  Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):

    Item ID
    Item Name
    Purchase Count
    Item Price
    Total Purchase Value




Most Profitable Items

  Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

    Item ID
    Item Name
    Purchase Count
    Item Price
    Total Purchase Value



As final considerations:

  You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
  You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
  You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
  See Example Solution for a reference on expected format.
